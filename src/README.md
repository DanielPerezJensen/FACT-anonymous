### This code is the code from the original paper.

Code for "[Generative causal explanations of black-box classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13913)" by Matt O'Shaughnessy, Greg Canal, Marissa Connor, Mark Davenport, and Chris Rozell (Proc. NeurIPS 2020). Requires only numpy (version 3.8.5 used), pytorch (version 3.8.5 used), and matplotlib (version 3.3.1 used) to generate results; matlab used to plot some results.

## Demo/quick start
`demo.py` contains code demonstrating the use of the generative causal explainer (GCE) class (`GCE.py`) and explanation plotting functions (`plotting.py`). The demo code reproduces Figure 3 (creating an explanation of a simple pretrained MNIST 3/8 classifier) and is the easiest place to start.
